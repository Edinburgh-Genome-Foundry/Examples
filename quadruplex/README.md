# Quadruplex DNA

Tetra-stranded DNA: guanine-rich *G-quadruplexes* and cytosine-rich *i-motifs*.


## i-motif DNA

Intercalated-motif DNA ([i-motif DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-motif_DNA) are cytosine-rich four-stranded quadruplex DNA structures.

Skolakova et al. describe a number of such motifs in *Systematic investigation of sequence requirements for DNA i-motif formation* ([Nucleic Acids Research, 2019, Vol. 47, No. 5 2177â€“2189](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz046). As a demonstration, we search for these motifs as sequences with Biopython, and as regular expressions (regex) with DNA Chisel: [quadruplex.py](quadruplex.py).


## G-quadruplex DNA

[G-quadruplexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-quadruplex) are guanine-rich four-stranded DNA structures.
